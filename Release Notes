# Release Notes

Forked archived repository in a non-buildable state and restored it to working state

## Phase 1 - Working Builds

Got working builds for x64 and ARM and did basic testing. Updated to latest s6. On x64 builds update to postgresql 13.

Used crude and rudimentary workarounds where required.

## Phase 2 - Branch and DEV builds

Improve using series of update branches. Commit test builds as doritoes/guacamole:dev.

Noted initial run of the container on Raspberry Pi 3 takes a very long time as only one thread is used by Java. Extremely slow in VNC and SSH testing. RDP connection works to Windows 10 Pro on x64 but not ARM.

Process to reproduce RDP issue

also try 0

also try installing freerpd from source

sudo apt-get update -y

sudo apt-get install git cmake cdbs zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libglib2.0-dev libxml2-dev libxext-dev libsystemd-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libcups2-dev libpcsclite-dev libavcodec-dev libavutil-dev libavresample-dev libswresample-dev libxkbfile-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxv-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev docbook-xsl libcairo2-dev xsltproc libusb-1.0-0-dev -y

sudo git clone git://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP.git --branch 2.2.0

cd FreeRDP

sudo cmake -DTARGET_ARCH=ARM -DWITH_X11=ON

sudo make

sudo make install

It installs to /usr/local/bin/xfreerdp, so it will probably overwrite 2.0.0 if you already have it installed.

If you leave out "--branch 2.2.0", you'll get 3.0.0-dev as of this post.
