# Release Notes

Forked archived repository in a non-buildable state and restored it to working state

## Phase 1 - Working Builds

Got working builds for x64 and ARM and did basic testing. Updated to latest s6. On x64 builds update to postgresql 13.

Used crude and rudimentary workarounds where required.

## Phase 2 - Branch and DEV builds

Improve using series of update branches. Commit test builds as doritoes/guacamole:dev.

Noted initial run of the container on Raspberry Pi 3 takes a very long time as only one thread is used by Java. Very slow in VNC and SSH testing. RDP connection not working possibly due to being so slow.
